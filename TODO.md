# TODO

Forward-looking list. Each entry: **what** to do, **why** it's deferred (not "shouldn't", just "not now"), and a **trigger** for when to revisit.

**For shipped items**, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). For the day-to-day commit history, `git log`. This file is "what's NOT done and why".

## Roadmap status — at a glance (2026-05-08)

Per Doc 14's milestone breakdown. Not authoritative — CHANGELOG is —
but kept current enough that "is X done?" doesn't require a 2,000-line
TODO scan to answer.

| Milestone        | Status                       | Notes |
|------------------|------------------------------|---|
| M0 Foundation    | ✅ shipped                    | tars-types / config / storage / melt / cache (L1) |
| M1 Single path   | ✅ shipped                    | tars-provider (8 backends) + Telemetry/Retry/CacheLookup middleware |
| M2 Multi-prov + Routing | ✅ shipped (M2 scope)  | Routing (Static + Tier) + CircuitBreaker + B-31 capability pre-flight. CostPolicy / LatencyPolicy / Ensemble deferred to M5 (need metrics infra) — not M2 blockers. |
| M3 Agent Runtime | ✅ shipped                    | Session / Turn / TurnGuard / WorkerAgent + Critic + run_task — see B-4 for *enhancements* on top of working baseline. |
| M4 Tools         | ✅ shipped                    | Tool trait + ToolRegistry + fs.read_file / fs.list_dir + MCP integration. fs.write_file gated on Backtrack/Saga (B-4). |
| M5 CLI/MELT      | 🟡 partial                   | tars-cli (init / probe / bench / plan / run / run-task / trajectory) shipped. Per-provider runtime metrics infra (B-8) NOT shipped — blocks Cost/Latency/Ensemble routing. |
| M6 Multi-tenant + Server | ❌ not started        | tars-security / HTTP+gRPC server / Auth/IAM/Budget/Guard middleware all blocked here. |
| M7 Web frontends | ❌ not started                | tui-shape outlined as B-19 (build-our-own, not fork-codex). |
| M8 Python bindings (`tars-py`) | 🟢 in progress      | Stages 1-4 + B-31 + B-20 W1+W2+W4 + v3 shipped. Remaining: B-20 v2 (typed Reject reasons), Pipeline.builder Python surface (B-6c). |
| M9 Output Validation + Eval | 🟡 W1+W2+W4+v3 shipped, W3 enabler shipped, W3 main pending | W3 enabler (Doc 17 Phase 1 — pipeline event store + body store + EventEmitter + `tars events` CLI + cohort tags) shipped 2026-05-08. W3 main body re-scoped per downstream consumer (2026-05-08): original "Rust evaluator runner + trait + sampler + subscription" is overengineered for the consumer's batch-mode use cases; revised plan = 30-line `tars.eval.write_score` Python helper + caller writes evaluator scripts as cron / CI / notebook against the event store. Online monitoring (recall drop alerts, context-saturation correlation) belongs in a separate Doc 19 / B-21 OTel exporter, not the evaluator path. |

### `tars-pipeline` specifically

**M2 deliverables done.** What's missing in the Doc 02 10-layer onion is
NOT a pipeline-crate gap — every missing layer is blocked on a different
crate that hasn't shipped:

| Missing layer            | Blocked on                                       | Unlocks at |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---|
| Auth / IAM middleware    | `tars-security` crate                            | M6 |
| Budget middleware        | `tars-storage` KVStore (B-7)                     | M0+ patchback |
| PromptGuard middleware   | `tars-tools` + ONNX classifier                   | D-4 (frozen — needs trigger) |
| L3 cache hooks (create/extend) | `ExplicitCacheProvider` (D-1)              | D-1 |
| CostPolicy / LatencyPolicy / EnsemblePolicy routing | per-provider metrics infra (B-8) | M5 |

Pipeline's trait + builder surface are stable; new layers ship as
`.layer(NewMiddleware)` one-liners on top. **No pipeline-internal
roadmap items pending.**

## Overengineering — defer-and-revisit list

These were called out in the self-review on 2026-05-03. Decision: **keep** for now (rip-them-out cost > carry cost in the short term), but each has a trigger condition. When the trigger fires we either commit to the abstraction or delete it.

### O-1. `HttpTransport` trait + `OutboundRequest` / `HttpResponse` / `StreamResponse` wrappers
- **Where**: `crates/tars-provider/src/transport.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Established pattern. All providers go straight through `HttpProviderBase.client`. wiremock + the existing integration tests cover everything we need today.
- **Trigger to commit**: A second test that genuinely benefits from a non-HTTP fake transport (e.g. a unit test that wants to assert "the adapter built this exact OutboundRequest" without spinning up wiremock).
- **Trigger to delete**: We hit `tars-pipeline` MVP without anyone needing it.

### O-2. `HttpProviderExtras` — `http_headers` / `env_http_headers` / `query_params`
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/http_extras.rs`, embedded via `#[serde(flatten)]` in 5 ProviderConfig variants
- **Why deferred**: Established pattern. No user has asked for any of these fields. None of our tests use them.
- **Trigger to commit**: First user request — most likely "I need `OpenAI-Organization` header set from env" or "Azure deployment ID in query string."
- **Trigger to delete**: 6 months without a user request → the `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` interaction noise outweighs the latent capability.

### O-3. `Pricing` as a configurable struct (5 × f64 fields)
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/usage.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Designed as if users will customize per-deployment. In practice we have ~5 providers × ~3 models = 15 const data points.
- **Better shape**: `const PRICING: &[(provider_id, model_pattern, Pricing)]` table with helper lookup. Users override only when they have private deployments with negotiated rates.
- **Trigger**: When we add a real cost-display feature (admin dashboard / billing export). The cost table will need to live somewhere — that's the moment to switch from "field on Capabilities" to a proper pricing module.

### O-4. `Capabilities` 12-field struct
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/capabilities.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Currently 0 readers — no routing layer, no pipeline middleware. Completely speculative.
- **Trigger to commit**: First Routing policy that actually filters by capability (e.g. `RequiresVision` model selection).
- **Trigger to slim**: At the moment we build Routing, audit what fields it really reads and drop the rest. Likely we end up with 5 fields (streaming / tool_use / structured_output / max_context / pricing).

### O-5. `Auth::Secret { secret: SecretRef }` nested enum variant
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/auth.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Cosmetic. `Auth::Env { var }` would read better than `Auth::Secret { secret: SecretRef::Env { var } }`.
- **Trigger to flatten**: If we add a second auth-class concept (e.g. mTLS client cert) that's NOT a "secret reference" — at that point the enum reshuffle is forced anyway.

### O-6. `ToolCallBuffer::take_started` flag
- **Where**: `crates/tars-provider/src/tool_buffer.rs`, used by `crates/tars-provider/src/backends/openai.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Functionally correct, just placed wrong. Stream-level state shoved into a struct named for tool calls.
- **Cleaner**: Either let `Started` events repeat (consumer dedupes — `ChatResponseBuilder` already handles it) and drop the flag, OR introduce a proper `StreamState { tool_buf, started_emitted, … }`.
- **Trigger**: Next time we add a third per-stream flag → tipping point for the rename.
- **2026-05-03 update (commit 67de40d)**: We added `pending_stop_reason` for the openai-7/22 fix. That's now **2** stream-level flags on `ToolCallBuffer` — one short of the trigger. Next added flag means "rename now".

### O-7. `SecretString` is theatre, not protection
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/secret.rs`
- **Why deferred**: The Display/Debug redaction does prevent accidental log leaks (real value). Memory-level protection (zeroize on drop, locked pages) is genuinely missing — but writing real secret-protection without a clear threat model is its own overengineering trap.
- **Trigger to harden**: First customer with a security review that asks "are secrets zeroized in memory?" Add `zeroize` crate at that point.
- **Rename consideration**: `RedactedDisplay<T>` would be more honest about scope. Defer to first non-secret use case (PII strings, etc.).

### O-8. `ProviderRegistry::{ids, len, is_empty}` "complete API"
- **Where**: `crates/tars-provider/src/registry.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Trivial. Either get used by routing or are never read.
- **Trigger to delete**: After Pipeline lands, grep `.ids()` `.len()` `.is_empty()` against the Registry. Anything with 0 callers — gone.

### O-9. `tars-config::builtin` 5-provider default table
- **Where**: `crates/tars-config/src/builtin.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Useful for "zero-config first-run" UX, but we have no first-run UX (no `tars init` command yet).
- **Trigger to keep**: When we ship a CLI binary with a `tars init` flow that scaffolds a minimal config — the defaults make user TOML one-liner short.
- **Trigger to delete**: If we never ship that CLI flow, the defaults are unused fixtures.

### O-10. Speculative documentation
- **Doc 06 §8** (Tenant provision/suspend/delete 7-step cascade) — designed for a system with no second tenant
- **Doc 09** (Storage Schema) — full Postgres schemas for tables that don't exist
- **Doc 13** (entire Operational Runbook) — 12 incident playbooks for incidents that haven't happened
- **Doc 12 §5** (gRPC), **§8** (WASM) — speculative API surfaces
- **Why deferred**: Already written. Reading them costs nothing. Implementing them prematurely WOULD cost something.
- **Trigger to revise**: When the actual subsystem ships, audit the doc for what we got wrong vs. right. Don't try to keep them current ahead of code.

## Audit follow-up — non-critical findings to revisit

The 2026-05-03 A.R.C. reviews (`3ab2b7fa`, `65be2621`, `71d49588`) flagged ~330 issues across three rounds. The critical + error tier was fixed across `9683ce8 / 67de40d / cf1605e / af2d8f1` — see CHANGELOG entries for the per-round details. The deferred residue:

### A-1. Test quality (148 warnings, 8 info)
Most warnings are `happy-path-only-enumeration` or `assertion-strength-mismatch` — tests cover the main path but not edge cases.
- **Trigger**: Dedicated test-hardening pass, or whenever we touch the relevant module for another reason.

### A-4. `events.rs` `ToolCallArgsDelta` lacks `id` field
- Correlation relies on `index` alone. If a provider ever reuses an index across calls in the same stream, args get cross-contaminated.
- **Trigger**: First time a provider's streaming protocol surfaces this. Anthropic and OpenAI both use stable index per stream today; not a real bug yet.

### A-6. `RequestContext` identity fields are `pub`-mut
- From audit `65be2621` (context-1). `tenant_id` / `principal_id` / `trace_id` are public + mutable, so production code holding `&mut RequestContext` could rotate them mid-request. Audit was disputed (test code in `tars-cache` legitimately mutates `tenant_id` to construct cross-tenant scenarios; locking down to private + setters touches 50+ call sites for marginal real safety) — but the dispute holds only **until M6 multi-tenant runtime exists**.
- **Trigger**: M6 — when there's a real security boundary the field mutability could cross.

---

## Real backlog (not overengineering)

### B-1. CLI providers: long-lived stream-json mode (Doc 01 §6.2.1)
- Current `claude_cli` / `gemini_cli` / `codex_cli` all spawn a fresh subprocess per call (cold start 200-500ms; codex's startup is heavier).
- **Goal**: Long-lived process pool with `--output-format stream-json` (claude/gemini) / sustained `codex exec --json` over a stdio session (codex). Low-latency interactive use.
- **Cost**: ~1 week of careful work (cancel guards, session pool lifecycle, JSONL bidi protocol). Per-CLI quirks compound — each one's session model differs.

### B-2. `tars-pipeline` middleware layers — remaining onion layers
- M2-tier middleware (Telemetry / Retry / CacheLookup / Routing / CircuitBreaker) is shipped — see CHANGELOG. **Still missing in the Doc 02 onion**:
  - **Auth / IAM** middleware: needs `tars-security` (Doc 14 M6).
  - **Budget** middleware: needs `tars-storage`'s `KVStore` (B-7's second half) for token-bucket state across restarts.
  - **PromptGuard** middleware: needs `tars-tools` + ONNX classifier (D-4 frozen).
  - **L3 cache hooks** (cache-create / cache-extend on existing CacheLookupMiddleware): depends on D-1 (`ExplicitCacheProvider`).
  - **CostPolicy / LatencyPolicy / EnsemblePolicy** for routing: need per-provider runtime metrics + (for Ensemble) a fan-out + merge primitive. All blocked on metrics infra (B-8 / M5).

### B-3. Hot reload for `ConfigManager` (Doc 06 §6)
- Currently load-once. Real-world: change `~/.config/tars/config.toml` and have it pick up without restart.
- **Trigger**: First user demo where "I want to switch providers without restarting" matters.

### B-4. M3 Agent Runtime — enhancements beyond the M3 baseline
- M3 is **fully shipped** — see CHANGELOG. Storage + runtime + agent primitive + AgentMessage envelope + all 3 default agents (Orchestrator + WorkerAgent in both stub and tool-using flavours + Critic) + multi-step `run_task` loop + `tars run-task` CLI + `tars-tools` crate (Tool trait + Registry + `fs.read_file`) + `PromptBuilder` extraction all live. The remaining items here are **enhancements** to a working baseline, not gates on M3 completion:
  - **`run_task` replan-on-Reject** — current MVP treats `VerdictKind::Reject` as task-failed. Doc 04 §4.2's full design has Reject trigger a fresh Orchestrator call with the rejection reason as feedback. Slot in when a real consumer hits "the Critic was right to reject but the task is still salvageable".
  - **Per-LLM-call observability inside Worker tool loops** — when WorkerAgent has tools, one `Agent::execute` drives N internal LLM calls + tool dispatches but the trajectory log only captures one StepStarted/LlmCallCaptured/StepCompleted triple (with summed usage + final-answer summary). New event variants `LlmSubcallCaptured` + `ToolCallExecuted` would expose the inner timeline. Trigger: lands alongside Backtrack/Saga (per-call replay needs the granularity anyway) OR when debugging-a-stuck-tool-loop becomes a regular pain point.
  - **`ContextStore` + `ContextCompactor`** (Doc 04 §3.3 / §5). Schema-aware history pruner so multi-step trajectories don't grow the prompt unboundedly. Sits between the Trajectory log and the next `AgentContext`. Trigger: when `run_task` traces start exceeding a model's context window in real use (especially likely once tool-using Workers chain reads).
  - **Block-composition `PromptBuilder`** (Doc 04 §6 full vision). Today's `PromptBuilder` (shipped `8fdeed1`) is fluent assembly of the request *recipe* — model + system + structured_output + temperature + tools. The Doc 04 §6 vision goes further: compose system prompts from typed *blocks* (persona + role + tool-doc + format-rules) so a tenant could rebrand the persona without touching role/format. No consumer needs the block variant today — wait for a second persona to ship (probably alongside multi-tenant work in M6).
  - **Backtrack + Saga compensation** (Doc 04 §6). Concrete `CompensationAction` types + `AgentEvent::CompensationExecuted` + the runtime hook that runs compensations in reverse on backtrack. Trigger: first Tool with externally-visible side effects (`fs.write_file`, `git push`, `web POST`) AND a real failure-recovery scenario where rolling them back matters. **Specifically blocks `fs.write_file` from shipping safely** — see B-9's "additional builtins" note.
  - **CLI: `tars trajectory replay <ID>`** — replays a trajectory's LLM/tool calls against the recorded inputs. Needed once Workers have real side effects (compensation interacts with replay). Trigger: lands with Backtrack.
- **Trigger / order**: ContextStore (when prompts grow) → Backtrack + Saga + replay together (when first side-effecting tool ships) → block-composition PromptBuilder (when multi-tenant rebranding needs it).

### B-5. `tars-cli` follow-on subcommands
- M1 / M2 / M3 surface is shipped (`tars run` + `tars plan` + `tars run-task` + `tars trajectory list/show`) — see CHANGELOG. Remaining CLI surface from Doc 07 §5:
  - `tars chat` — interactive REPL (long-lived process, multi-turn). Where the breaker / pipeline-cache cross-call value actually pays off; would build on the same agent triad `tars run-task` already exposes but with multi-turn context state.
  - `tars trajectory delete <ID>` — needs a retention policy decision (rolling window? size cap? both?). Today the file just grows.
  - `tars trajectory replay <ID>` — needs the multi-step Agent loop (B-4) to know what "replay" means at the action level.
  - `tars trajectory diff <ID-A> <ID-B>` — same prompt, two providers / two configs, what differed. Useful demo when EnsemblePolicy lands.
  - `tars dash` — launcher for the future web dashboard (M7).
  - Shell completions (bash / zsh / fish).
  - `--output json` / CI mode adapter (GitHub PR comment / junit-xml).
- **Trigger**: each item independent. `chat` is the most likely first since multi-turn proves out the runtime / cache / breaker cross-call value.

### B-6. PyO3 + napi-rs bindings (Doc 12 §6, §7)
- PyO3 wheel **shipped** — Stage 1+2+3 (Pipeline / Provider / Session / response_schema / `~/.tars/config.toml` / `tars init`). See CHANGELOG M8. Remaining items:
  - **B-6a. `Response.telemetry` per-call surface (Stage 4)** — see B-15.
  - **B-6b. napi-rs (Node)** — same trait surface, different binding crate. **Trigger**: first Node user. Design constraint: API shape (`Pipeline.from_default(id)` / `Session(pipeline, system, ...)` / `Response.telemetry`) must stay identical across Python / Node / future Go so consumers can switch languages without re-learning the model.
  - **B-6c. PyO3 `PipelineBuilder` for custom middleware** — currently `Pipeline.from_default()` uses a hardcoded layer order (telemetry → cache_lookup → retry → provider). Python can't inject a custom middleware. **Trigger**: first consumer that wants e.g. a custom rate-limit layer or auth-refresh layer specifically from the Python side. downstream consumer and other near-term consumers don't need this.

### B-15. Stage 4 — `Response.telemetry` per-call observability surface — ✅ shipped (`<unreleased>`)
- See CHANGELOG M8 for shipping detail. Surface: `Response.telemetry.{cache_hit, retry_count, retry_attempts, provider_latency_ms, pipeline_total_ms, layers}`. Plumbed via `RequestContext.telemetry: SharedTelemetry` so every middleware writes through the same Arc<Mutex<...>>. Session.send aggregates across the auto-loop's multiple model calls under one handle.
- **Out of scope (preserved as future)**: full OTel exporter (B-8); per-HTTP-attempt visibility (codex exposes `attempt: u64` — tars aggregates retries inside the middleware; revisit if real debugging need shows up); `CallObserver` push-trait (B-18).

### B-16. Session ↔ EventStore integration (durability + multi-agent blackboard)
- **Where**: `tars-runtime/src/{session,event}.rs`, plumbing into existing `tars-storage::EventStore`.
- **What**: Plug `Session` into the existing trajectory + EventStore pipeline rather than build a parallel `SessionStore`. Session optionally takes `Arc<dyn EventStore>` + `TrajectoryId`; emits `AgentEvent` variants for turn lifecycle (TurnOpened / TurnCommitted / TurnRolledBack / ToolCalled / HistoryTrimmed / HistoryReset). `Session::resume(store, trajectory_id)` reads back the trajectory and rebuilds the in-memory `Vec<Turn>`.
- **Why this shape**: tars already has the trajectory (event log, in `tars-runtime`) + blackboard (`EventStore`, in `tars-storage`) two-layer split — agents emit events, store persists. Session is just another agent-shaped thing emitting into the same stream. A new `SessionStore` trait would be parallel infrastructure for the same concern. Multi-agent scenarios (Orchestrator + Worker + Critic each owning a Session writing to the same store) become natural under this model. - **Note on Turn-as-data vs Turn-as-projection**: long-term `Vec<Turn>` should become a derived projection over the event log rather than the primary state, because true async conversations (multi-agent cross-writes, webhook event injection, long-running async tools) don't map cleanly onto strict turn boundaries. Current Turn-as-data is the right pragmatic call (downstream consumer's 80-line Session is turn-based; downstream consumer has none of the async patterns yet); after B-16 lands, the migration to "Turn = `fn turns(events) -> Vec<Turn>` view" is a small refactor since events are already primary. **Don't pre-build the projection now** — wait for the first async consumer.
- **Trigger**: First long-running downstream consumer review where mid-process restart loses 80% of work. Or first multi-agent shared-conversation scenario. Until then, in-memory-only Session is fine.

### B-17. Optional — LLM-summarize compaction (codex-style)
- **Where**: New module under `tars-runtime/src/session/compact.rs` + integration into `Session::trim_to_budget`.
- **What**: When trim would otherwise drop turns, instead invoke the model with a `SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT` to generate a summary of the dropping section, replace those turns with the summary turn. Preserves semantic intent at cost of an extra LLM call.
- **Why deferred**: Current chars-budget trim is "drop oldest whole turn" which is brutally simple but works fine for downstream consumer's profile (review batches don't hit 100k tokens of useful history anyway — at that scale you usually want a fresh Session per PR not a long-lived one). Compaction has real LLM-call cost + risk of summary losing key details.
- **Trigger**: First user complaint that "long agentic loop dropped a critical detail in trim". Or first product where 50+ turn conversations are normal (chat product, not batch reviewer).
- **Pattern reference**: production-tested compaction implementations include an `InitialContextInjection::BeforeLastUserMessage` mode for mid-turn invocation.

### B-18. Optional — `CallObserver` trait (rust-side push hook) — ❌ 撤回
- ~~原 design：trait + push callback。~~
- **撤销原因**：B-20 (Evaluation Framework) 用 EventStore stream 解决了 cross-call 聚合的同一类问题，且解耦更彻底（pipeline ↔ aggregator 通过 events 而不是 trait callback 耦合）。CallObserver 写出来会跟 EvaluatorRunner 形成两条同质机制。
- **如果你需要"跨 pipeline 跨 call 聚合 metric"** → 用 B-20 的 OnlineEvaluatorRunner，不是 CallObserver。

### B-20. Output Validation + Evaluation Framework — ⭐ 优先级最高（M9）
- **设计文档**: [Doc 15 — Output Validation](./docs/architecture/15-output-validation.md) + [Doc 16 — Evaluation Framework](./docs/architecture/16-evaluation-framework.md)
- **拆分**(2026-05-05 review 后调整,3-wave 降低 PyO3 单点风险):
  - **Wave 1 (Rust-only Validator framework)** — ✅ shipped 2026-05-07. `OutputValidator` trait + `ValidationOutcome` enum + `ProviderError::ValidationFailed` + 3 built-in validators (JsonShape / NotEmpty / MaxLength) + `ValidationMiddleware` + `Response.validation_summary` 字段 + `RequestContext.validation_outcome` 侧信道 + 17 单元测试。详见 CHANGELOG B-20 W1 段。
  - **Wave 2 (PyO3 binding)** — ✅ shipped 2026-05-08. Python validators 通过 `[(name, callable), ...]` 挂到 `Pipeline.{from_default,from_config,from_str}`。`PyValidatorAdapter` 把 Python callback 桥接成 Rust `OutputValidator` trait；4 个 outcome pyclasses (`tars.Pass / Reject / FilterText / Annotate`)。Buggy validator (raise / wrong return type) 自动 catch 成 permanent `ValidationFailed` — worker 不会被 user-side bug 打死。17 个 pytest in `crates/tars-py/python/tests/test_validators.py`。详见 CHANGELOG B-20 W2 段。
  - **Wave 3 (downstream consumer 接入 + Evaluation framework Doc 16, ~7.5 天)** — Doc 16 完整实施(`Evaluator` / `AsyncEvaluator` traits + `LlmCallFinished` / `EvaluationScored` events + `OnlineEvaluatorRunner` / `OfflineEvaluatorRunner` + Built-in evaluators + tars-py `tars.eval.Evaluator` base + `Pipeline.with_event_store` API + SQL templates),downstream consumer 删 inline `_known_rule_ids` 并切到 Pipeline-attached validator + dogfood。
- **关键设计决定 (Cache × Validator 交互, W1 实施时锁定 — ⚠️ 实现与设计不一致，W4 修复)**:
  - **设计意图**: Cache stores raw Response (pre-Filter)。Cache hit 仍跑 validator chain。validator 是 pure，重跑 = CPU local cost only，远比 wire round-trip 便宜。多 caller 共享 cache 安全。改 validator 不改 cache key。Validator failure NOT bypass cache。
  - **W1 实现的 bug** (downstream consumer (2026-05-08) dogfood flag 引发的 audit 找到): `ValidationMiddleware` Filter 时把 stream re-emit 成 post-Filter events (`validation.rs:225-232`)，cache 看到的就是 post-Filter 流。**任何 Filter validator + Cache 同时存在 → cache 存的不是 raw**。multi-caller 不同 validator 链 → silent corruption；单链情况下 cache 也永远拿不回 raw。Side channel `rec.filtered_response` 已经存在但被冗余化了。
  - **修复 → 见 B-20.W4**。在那之前，consumer / 任何 multi-role consumer 必须 per-role 独立 Pipeline 实例，不要复用同一 Pipeline + 不同 validator 链。
- **Why 这个排在 B-16 / B-17 / B-19 前面**:
  - downstream consumer dogfood (2026-05-04 / 05) 暴露的两类痛点都在这里解：(a) 模型造 rule_id / 漏 evidence tag → validation；(b) "metrics 突然掉了我们看看怎么回事" → evaluation。
  - downstream consumer 现在 inline 实现了 `_known_rule_ids` post-filter (见 the downstream consumer)，是 v1 validation 的占位实现 — 等 Doc 15 落地直接 migrate 出来。
  - 整个 LLM 系统的 observability + quality gating 是 cross-consumer 基础设施，比单产品功能（compact / tui）优先级高。
- **依赖**:
  - 依赖 `Pipeline.builder()` API 暴露到 Python (内部 B-6c) — 这一条作为 Doc 15 / Wave 1 的子任务一起做。
  - 依赖 EventStore 在 Pipeline 层可用 — 当前只在 tars-runtime 用，需要把 `Arc<dyn EventStore>` 接到 Pipeline 上。
- **预估总工作量**: 12 天 (两个 wave 加起来)，可分 wave 出 wheel。
- **与 B-15 (Stage 4 Telemetry) 的关系**: 互补不重叠。`Response.telemetry` 装 infrastructure 指标 (cache_hit / retry_count / latency)；evaluation 装 semantic 指标 (rubric grounded rate / evidence filled rate)。仪表板可以 cross-join 两者出"指标突然掉的同时 retry_count 涨了吗"这种问题。
- ** points (落进 W1.1 / W2.1 一起做,不单独 backlog)**:
  - **Tags 字段** — `LlmCallFinished.tags: Vec<String>` + `EvaluationScored.tags: Vec<String>`,事件 schema 一开始就带,默认空。caller 通过 `RequestContext::with_tags()` / `Session::tagged()` helper 打标。Cohort 分析靠 `WHERE 'dogfood_2026_05_05' IN tags` 一句 SQL,远比每加一种过滤维度加一个事件字段干净。
  - **OnlineEvaluatorRunner sampling 配置** — `EvaluatorSampling::{Always, Rate(f64), Stratified, OnDimDrop}` 四种模式。`Always` 是 deterministic evaluator 默认；`OnDimDrop { watch_dim, threshold }` 是 区别于固定采样的智能采样——便宜 evaluator 持续跑,贵的(LLM-as-judge)只在另一个 dim 掉到阈值下时触发,**节省 LLM-judge 的真钱**。OnDimDrop 写进 trait,即使 v1 默认 `Always`,接口为未来留位。

### B-20.v3. Python `Response.validation_summary` 暴露 — ✅ shipped 2026-05-08 (~1h)
- `Response.validation_summary` → frozen pyclass `ValidationSummary { validators_run: list[str], outcomes: dict[str, dict], total_wall_ms: int }`。`outcomes[name]` shape: `{"outcome": "pass"|"filter"|"annotate", "dropped"?: list[str], "metrics"?: dict}`。Reject 不进 outcomes — short-circuit 进 `TarsProviderError`。
- 3 个 pytest 验证：filter outcome 带 dropped list、no-validators 空 summary、Pass/exported 类型。详见 CHANGELOG B-20 v3 段。
- **由来**: downstream consumer (2026-05-08) 反馈，dogfood 报表的 metrics 列前置依赖。

### B-20.v2. Typed `ValidationOutcome::Reject { reason: ValidationReason }` — ⭐ unblocks  consumer parse→structured pipeline (1-2 d)
- **现状 (W1+W2 shipped 后)**: `Reject { reason: String, retriable: bool }` — string-only。Python 侧 `TarsProviderError(kind="validation_failed", is_retriable=bool)` 只把 reason 字符串塞进 message。caller 没法 programmatic match 失败原因。
- **inconsistency**: B-31 v4 已经把 `CompatibilityReason{kind, message, detail_json}` 做成 typed enum + structured detail。validator 失败也该一致 — 不然 fix-stage 又得 grep `e.message`，回到 B-31 v1 那种字符串脆弱契约。
- **shape**:
  - 引入 `ValidationReason` enum (`#[non_exhaustive]`)：`JsonShape{json_path, parse_error}` / `NotEmpty{field}` / `MaxLength{field, length, max}` / `Custom{kind: String, message: String, detail: Option<serde_json::Value>}`。
  - 内置 validator 用对应 typed variant；Python user-side validator 走 `Custom` (caller 给 kind+message+detail)。
  - Python 兼容入口: `tars.Reject(reason=str)` 自动包成 `Custom{kind="user", message=reason, detail=None}`；新增 `tars.Reject.typed(kind, message, detail=None)` 显式 typed 路径。
  - `ProviderError::ValidationFailed { validator, reason: ValidationReason, retriable }`；Python `TarsProviderError` 加 `validation_reason: dict` 属性 (`{kind, message, detail}`) 给 caller programmatic 访问。
- **预估**: 1-2 天。改动跨 `tars-types/validation.rs` + `tars-pipeline/validation.rs` + 3 builtin + `tars-py/{validation.rs, errors.rs}`。需要 deprecate-not-break 现有 `reason: str` 入口。
- **Trigger**:  consumer 开 Tier 2 #4 (parse → structured pipeline) 之前必须 ship。Tier 1 #1/#2/#3 用 FilterText 路径不阻塞，可以并行落。
- **依赖**: 无。
- **由来**: downstream consumer (2026-05-08) 反馈，详见 conversation log。

### B-20.W4. Cache × Validator interaction fix — ✅ shipped 2026-05-08 (A2 路线)
- **状态**: A2 路线落地 — onion 移到 `Telemetry → Validation → Cache → Retry → Provider` + 砍 `Reject{retriable}` 字段（`ValidationFailed` 总是 `ErrorClass::Permanent`）。两个 W4 regression test 在 `tars-pipeline/src/validation/tests.rs` 现在直接通过（`#[ignore]` 已删）。详见 CHANGELOG B-20 W4 段。
- **历史诊断（保留作 audit 留痕）**:
- **bug 1 (cache 存 post-Filter)**: `ValidationMiddleware` 在 Filter 改写 response 后 re-emit post-Filter events (`tars-pipeline/src/validation.rs:225-232`)，Cache 看到的是 ValidationMiddleware re-emit 之后的 stream，于是 cache 存 post-Filter。test 1 断言 cache 应存 raw "hello world"，实际是 "hello"。
- **bug 2 (cache hit 不跑 validator)**: 当前 onion 顺序 `Telemetry → CacheLookup → Retry → Validation → Provider`，Cache 在 Validation 外层。Cache hit 直接短路返回 cached events，**Validation 根本不被调用**。test 2 断言第二次（hit）`telemetry.layers` 含 `"validation"`，实际不含。这条比 bug 1 严重 — W1 doc §2 "validators rerun on hit" 跟 onion 不兼容。
- **后果**:
  - multi-caller 不同 validator 链共享同一 Pipeline + cache: 第二个 caller cache hit 拿到的是第一个 caller filter 过的内容，且新 validator 链不会跑 — silent corruption。
  - 单 validator 链情况下: cache 永远拿不回 raw；换 validator 配置后 hit 仍返回老 cached payload + 不重跑新 validator → 配置改动等于隐性 SemVer break。
  - W1 doc §2 "Cache stores raw Response (pre-validation), validators rerun on hit" 与实现两条都不一致。
- **fix 选项 (须选一)**:
  - **A. 改 onion 顺序**（推荐）: 移到 `Telemetry → Validation → CacheLookup → Retry → Provider`。Validation 在 Cache 外面 → cache hit 仍走 Validation。同时 ValidationMiddleware 不再需要 re-emit raw vs filtered 分支（Cache 看不到 Validation 输出）。代价: `ValidationFailed{retriable:true}` 不再触发 `RetryMiddleware`（Validation 在 Retry 外）。要么把 retry 逻辑挪进 ValidationMiddleware 自己，要么接受 "validation-driven retry 不存在" 的语义（更干净）。改动: 调 PipelineBuilder 调用顺序 (~3 处 caller)、调 Doc 02 onion 图 + Doc 15 §2、删 ValidationMiddleware 里的 `filtered_any` re-emit 分支、删现有"validation 从 cache hit replay drain"那段注释。
  - **B. 维持 onion + 仅修 re-emit**: 让 ValidationMiddleware 始终 re-emit `events_held`(raw)。**只修 bug 1，不修 bug 2** — cache hit 仍跳过 validator。doc 必须明写 "validators only run on cache miss" 这条限制。代价低但 W1 设计契约的 "rerun on hit" 永远做不到。
  - 选 A — Tier 1 落地前必须解决 multi-chain 安全；B 把"caller 必须保证 cache 命名空间隔离"的负担推给 consumer，又得在每个 consumer 重复一次。
- **预估**: 选 A → 1-2 天（onion 改动 + 5 处 doc 同步 + retry 语义决定 + 验证 W1 17 个 unit test 仍通过）。选 B → 半天。
- **Trigger**: consumer-side Tier 1 #1 (snippet validator) ship 之前必须修。
- **依赖**: 无。
- **由来**: downstream consumer (2026-05-08) raised "single-validator-chain assumption" flag → tars 端 audit + 写 failing test 发现实际 bug 比 audit 想的严重一层（不止"chain 不一致 corruption"，是"任何 Filter + Cache 共存 + Cache hit 不验证"）。

### B-19. `tars-tui` — interactive terminal UI (path C: build-our-own, not fork-codex)
- **Where**: New crate `crates/tars-tui/` (doesn't exist yet). Consumer of `tars-runtime::Session` + `tars-pipeline::Pipeline`. ratatui-based.
- **What**: Interactive terminal frontend for `tars chat`-style multi-turn conversations. v1 scope: chat history rendering, streaming markdown tokens, tool-call display (folded → expanded), slash commands (`/clear` / `/fork` / `/save` / `/quit`), status bar (model / usage / cache hit / latency), multi-line input with editing shortcuts. Sized at ~3-5k lines for v1.
- **Why "build our own" — codex's TUI is not directly reusable**:
  - codex's `tui/` is **57,736 lines / 102 files** and talks to codex's runtime through `app-server-protocol` — an **18,889-line type surface** assuming codex-specific concepts: rollout files, sandbox events, MCP tool dispatch, approval workflows, apply_patch notifications, ChatGPT auth modes, personality/skill/plugin injection. Not portable abstractions; product-specific to codex.
  - **Path A (implement codex's app-server-protocol on tars)** — rejected. Maps to "build all of codex inside tars" — sandbox + MCP + apply_patch + approval + ChatGPT + personalities. ~8-12 weeks. End state: tars becomes codex-clone, loses its library identity.
  - **Path B (fork codex TUI, swap backend)** — rejected. ~70% of those 102 files are codex-product UI (voice / approval / MCP / apply_patch / theme picker / onboarding / multi-agents / realtime / collaboration_modes / etc.) that tars doesn't have backends for. Remaining ~30 files are coupled to codex's event types (chatwidget.rs alone is 11k lines around codex's specific ChatEvent shape) and need rewriting. Net: ~3-4 weeks of work plus permanent fork-maintenance debt as codex iterates.
  - **Path C (build our own with public-domain rendering utilities)** — chosen. Use public-domain rendering utility crates (markdown render / stream, line wrapping, slash-command parsing) as inputs. Write own app loop / chat widget / input box / status bar around tars's Session API. ~2-3 weeks to v1, no maintenance debt.
- **v1 scope (what's in)**:
  - Multi-turn chat with `tars.Session` backing
  - Streaming token rendering with markdown
  - Tool call display (collapsed by default; expand on cursor / Enter to see args + result JSON)
  - Slash commands: `/clear` `/fork` `/save <path>` `/load <path>` `/reset` `/quit` `/model <id>`
  - Status bar: model id / token counts (in / out / cached) / `Response.telemetry.cache_hit` / latency
  - Multi-line input: Ctrl+Enter to send, ↑/↓ for history, Ctrl+C to interrupt mid-stream
  - Theme: minimal — fg/bg/accent/error 4 colors, no theme picker
- **v1 scope (what's deferred — explicit "not now" list)**:
  - Voice input (codex `voice.rs` 486 lines) — wait for first user request
  - Approval / permission prompts (codex's sandbox UI) — depends on B-2 sandbox middleware which is itself deferred
  - MCP tool UI — depends on MCP integration which tars doesn't have (would be M10+)
  - Apply-patch / diff rendering — tars doesn't do code editing
  - ChatGPT account login UI — tars uses env-var auth model
  - Theme picker — single hardcoded theme until someone asks
  - Onboarding wizard — tars expects users who already ran `tars init`
  - Auto-update prompts — leave to package manager
  - Multi-agent UI / collaboration modes — depends on multi-Session orchestration patterns that haven't crystallized
- **Trigger**: After Stage 4 (B-15 telemetry) and Session+EventStore (B-16) ship — both are dependencies for the status bar and `/save` `/load` commands respectively. Realistic landing target: M9 or M10.
- **Out of scope vs. `tars chat` CLI subcommand (B-5)**: `tars chat` could be a one-line entry point that launches `tars-tui`, OR a much simpler line-oriented REPL without ratatui. Probably both — `tars chat --tui` opens the rich UI, `tars chat` alone gives a minimal readline loop. Decided when B-19 lands.

## Brainstorm 存盘 (Day-2 + Day-3, 2026-05-05)

下面 7 条是 downstream consumer dogfood 反馈 + 跨工程师 brainstorm 期间提到的"未来需要但当前不挡路"的架构方向。**全部明确不在 M9 范围**——M9 只做 B-20（Validation + Evaluation）。这些 brainstorm 落盘给将来真有 trigger 时翻出来对照用。

### B-21. OpenTelemetry distributed tracing exporter
- **What**: 在 `tars-melt` (M5 本就规划) 落地完整 OTel exporter。tars 内部 `tracing::*` 事件 → OTLP → Jaeger / DataDog / Grafana Tempo。带 session_id → turn_id → span_id 的 hierarchical context propagation。
- **半成品现状**: TelemetryMiddleware 已经在发完整 tracing event；缺的是 `tracing-opentelemetry` + OTLP exporter。约 1.5 周。
- **Trigger**: 多阶 agent 调用（orchestrator + worker + critic）的 timeline 调试痛了——光看 `pipeline_total_ms` 不够，要瀑布图。downstream consumer dogfood 可能是第一个 user。
- **Pattern reference**: a standalone OTel exporter crate is the right shape (OTLP / metrics / traces in one place, decoupled from the runtime).
- **关键设计 — 不能只做 flat trace_id **:
  - tars 当前 `RequestContext.trace_id` 是扁平的——一整个请求一个 id,**没有 parent-child 关系**。multi-step agent 跑完看不出哪一阶段花多久。
  - Run tree 模型 (每个 LLM/tool call 是一个 run,带 parent_run_id 形成树) 是这一片观测层值得做的形态。OTel 的 span 模型本来就是这棵树。
  - 实施时**必须**给 `RequestContext` 加 `span_id: SpanId` + `parent_span_id: Option<SpanId>`,新事件 `SpanStarted` / `SpanFinished` 进 EventStore,每层 middleware / agent / tool 进入退出都打。
  - 落地后:Jaeger 瀑布图 + SQL `WHERE op='critic.review'` 直接查"过去 1d critic.review 这个 op 平均花多久"——比 `pipeline_total_ms` 一个总数有用得多。
  - 不做这一层,B-21 就退化成"加一个 OTLP exporter"——半成品,真用户拿到瀑布图发现"trace 全是孤立点没有结构"。
- **codex 借鉴清单 (实施时一起带,不单独 backlog)**:
  - **W3C Traceparent 跨服务传播** —— codex `otel/src/trace_context.rs:19-36`:`set_parent_from_w3c_trace_context(headers)` + `current_span_w3c_trace_context() -> W3cTraceContext` + `traceparent_context_from_env()`。tars 当前 `trace_id` 是内部生成,无法跟上下游(downstream consumer 嵌进 web app / downstream consumer 被 RPC 调起)的已有 trace 串起来。**实施时加 `RequestContext::from_traceparent` / `to_traceparent`**——tars trace 跟外部 Jaeger/DataDog 自动衔接。
  - **Dual-stream event macros** —— codex `otel/src/events/shared.rs:4-52` 提供 `log_event!` / `trace_event!` 两个宏 + target prefix 约定。同事件 emit 两次按 target 路由到不同后端(logs → file/Loki; traces → OTel span)。当前 tars `tracing::info!` 一锅端没法分流。**实施时建 `tars_melt::{log_event!, trace_event!}` 两个宏 + 标准 target 前缀约定**。
  - **Metrics naming taxonomy** —— codex `otel/src/metrics/names.rs:1-48` 集中 48 个 metric 常量,层级命名:`<subsystem>.<entity>.<measure>_<unit>`(`pipeline.turn.e2e_duration_ms` / `provider.responses_api.ttft_duration_ms`)。tars 现在 `pipeline_total_ms` / `provider_latency_ms` 风格不一致,半年后会 churn。**实施时做一个 `tars_metrics::names` 模块集中常量**,去掉 codex 的 `codex.` 前缀,采用同样的层级 taxonomy。

### B-22. Shadow Replay — 模型替换防退化体系
- **What**: 把生产 EventStore 中代表性 trace 标记为 `golden`；新 `ShadowRunner` 重发这些请求到候选 provider/model，背靠背 diff 评分。CLI: `tars shadow --dataset regression-v1 --provider gemini-3 > report.json`。
- **复用基础**: 90% 跟 OnlineRunner / OfflineRunner 共代码，仅多一个"重发 + diff"模式 + LlmCallFinished `tags` 字段(已在 B-20 加进 schema)。约 4-5 天（在 B-20 落地之后）。
- **Trigger**: 第一次模型替换（OpenAI 暗改 / 想切 Gemini-3 / 想切本地）。当前 downstream consumer 已经在讨论 gemini-3-flash-preview 切换。
- **Why 不进 M9**: 需要 EventStore + Evaluator 已经稳；过早做就是空架子。
- ** points (B-22 实施时一起带)**:
  - **`PairwiseEvaluator` trait** — 单 response 评分 (`Evaluator::score`) 之外加一个 pairwise 接口 `compare(req, a, b) -> A | B | Tie + confidence`。**Shadow Replay 的核心动作就是 pairwise** ("切到 gemini-3 后比之前好还是差?"),没这接口做不了。新事件 `PairwiseScored { trace_id_a, trace_id_b, evaluator_name, verdict }` 写 EventStore。
  - **`Dataset` 一等 typed 对象** — 不是"一堆 jsonl 文件"或"一组 trace_id 临时变量"。`Dataset { id, name, version, trace_ids, metadata }` 持久化在 EventStore,API 包括 `create_dataset` / `fork_dataset` / `dataset_traces`。`tars dataset create --name regression-v1 --tag dogfood_2026_05_05 --schema-compliance ">0.8"` 一句话从 production trace 沉淀出 regression set。与 tars library positioning 一致(无 hosted UI,纯 library 形态)。
  - 这两条**都是 Shadow 的硬依赖**——B-22 实施 spec 必须包含。

### B-23. Circuit Breaker → Routing fallback 最后一公里
- **What**: tars 已有 `CircuitBreakerMiddleware` + `Routing` layer（M2 shipped），但"circuit_open → 自动 fallback 到下一个 candidate"的 wiring 可能不完整。验证 + 补全，让"主 provider 熔断 → 自动切 candidate"真正可用。
- **Trigger**: 第一次跨 provider fallback 需求。downstream consumer 当前 critic 退化时还是手工配置降级，自动化是优化。
- **估时**: 1-2 天补 wiring + 写测试。

### B-24. Prompt Registry / A/B Routing
- **What**: Prompt-as-code，远程下发（从 git / 配置中心），SemVer 版本号；`Router` 层支持按 prompt_version 比例分流；`LlmCallFinished` 带 `prompt_version`，走 EventStore SQL 直接出 v1 vs v2 评分对比。
- **当前**: downstream consumer 把 prompt 写死在 Python 文件里，改 prompt 要发 PR。规模化后这条会痛。
- **Trigger**: 团队扩大到 prompt 改动需要灰度 / 多人并行迭代时；或者第一次想 A/B 测试两个 prompt 版本时。
- **依赖**: B-20 EvalFramework 已落（提供分数）。

### B-25. Semantic Cache Middleware（向量相似度短路）
- **What**: 在 Retry 之前加一层 `SemanticCacheMiddleware`。相似 prompt 命中阈值直接返回缓存的 Response，跳过 Provider 调用。挂 Redis+Vector / Qdrant。命中后 LlmCallFinished 标 `cache_kind: Semantic`，evaluator 仍跑（监控缓存是否劣化质量）。
- **Trigger**: 业务流量上来发现"重复思考"占大头；或者 Provider API 延迟开始疼时。当前 downstream consumer 量级用 exact-match L1/L2 cache 够。
- **Why 推后**: 增加运行时依赖（vector store），第一个用户没要前不上。

### B-26. LLM FinOps — Token / Cost 聚合 + Quota 中间件
- **What**:
  - 内置 Price Card（per-model USD/1M token）
  - `LlmCallFinished` 加 `cost_usd: f64` 字段
  - `QuotaMiddleware`：按 tenant / user / session 设 budget，超 → 拦截 OR 自动降级到便宜模型
- **EventStore SQL 福利**: 有了之后"过去 7 天哪个用户花了多少钱"一句 SQL 就能查
- **Trigger**: 第二个 user 进来分账时；或者首次出现"被打爆账单"事件。当前 downstream consumer 单用户单机器跑批，没账单焦虑。
- **依赖**: B-20 EventStore 已落（cost 进 LlmCallFinished payload）。

### B-27. Pre-flight Guardrails — Input 安全门
- **What**: 在请求到 Provider 之前的拦截层。Prompt injection 检测（regex / 小分类器）、PII 擦除（手机/信用卡/SSN → 占位符，response 回来再还原）。触发 → HTTP 400，不消耗 Provider token。
- **跟 ValidationMiddleware 区别**: Guardrail 是 input 层（请求前），Validation 是 output 层（响应后）。混不得：guardrail 是安全门，validation 是契约校验。
- **Trigger**: 第一个公开/多用户产品上线时；或合规要求出现时。当前 downstream consumer 内部使用，prompt 受信，不挡。
- **Why 推后**: 加运行时依赖（分类器模型 / 正则库），且只对外部输入有意义；当前没该场景。

### B-28. DPO / SFT 数据导出（数据飞轮）
- **What**: EventStore 加 `FeedbackReceived` event variant（user 反馈或业务回放信号），`tars dump-trace` CLI 支持 DPO / SFT format 输出。
- **Why 不做 exporter**: 业务 specific——chosen/rejected 怎么定义、format 用 DPO 还是 SFT 还是 PPO，每家不同。tars 提供数据萃取通道（最薄）+ 留 event variant 位即可，**不内置任何 fine-tuning format converter**。
- **Trigger**: 第一个想 fine-tune 的 user 出现。当前 downstream consumer 没在做。
- **现在能做的最薄一步**: 加 `FeedbackReceived` event variant + 在 EventStore schema 留位（30 行），exporter 不做。Brainstorm 期间已经讨论过这条最低投入选项。

---

**Brainstorm 共识**:

- Day-2/Day-3 这 8 条全部"未来需要但不挡当前 M9"
- M9 单独完成 B-20（Validation + Evaluation 一起）= downstream consumer 完整 unblock + 整个 LLM 系统的 observability/quality gating 基础设施
- M9 之后第一个候选是 **B-21 OTel exporter**——半成品最熟、downstream consumer 多阶 agent 调试当前痛点
- 长期 tars 演进的"全景图": Control Plane（Config / Router / CB） + Data Plane（Pipeline / Middleware / Provider） + Observability（tracing + EventStore） + Intelligence Plane（EvalRunner / ShadowRunner / 数据萃取）


### 真实代码 Deep Review 找到的 3 个 gap (2026-05-05)

外部 reviewer 看了 `routing.rs` / `retry.rs` / `middleware.rs` / `provider.rs` 真实代码后指出 3 个 production-real 的 gap。已验证全部命中。处置:

#### B-31. Routing capability pre-flight check — ✅ shipped (`<unreleased>`)
- **Where**: `tars-pipeline/src/routing.rs:202-285`
- **What shipped**:
  - `tars_types::ChatRequest::compatibility_check(&Capabilities) -> CompatibilityCheck` — checks tools / structured_output / thinking / vision; aggregates ALL incompatibility reasons in a single pass (caller sees the full list, not just the first failure).
  - `CompatibilityCheck { Compatible, Incompatible { reasons: Vec<String> } }` — 2-state (deliberately not 3-state — see code-comment for "we don't have global view at per-candidate level" reasoning; routing layer synthesizes the global verdict).
  - `RoutingService::call` candidate loop now calls `compatibility_check` *before* `provider.stream(...)`. Incompatible candidates are skipped with a structured warn log; their reasons are collected into `skipped_with_reasons`.
  - When all candidates are skipped (no wire-level errors), routing returns `ProviderError::InvalidRequest("no candidate could honour request capabilities; skipped: <id>: [<reasons>], …")` — a `Permanent` class error, retry won't help.
- **Why this shape (vs codex's `SafetyCheck` 3-state)**: codex's Skip/Reject is a per-action verdict. Per-candidate compatibility doesn't tell us whether the *request* is malformed globally — only the routing layer (which sees all candidates) knows that. Keeping per-candidate at 2-state and letting the loop aggregate is cleaner.
- **Tests**: 7 new unit tests in `tars-types::chat::tests` (each cap field individually + multi-reason aggregation), 3 new routing tests in `tars-pipeline::routing::tests` (skip-and-try-next / all-skipped-returns-InvalidRequest / pass-through-when-compatible).
- **Behavior change for callers**: requests with tools/vision/thinking that previously wire-400'd or silently drop'd at non-supporting providers now get clean local skips. downstream consumer dogfood will see fewer mysterious provider errors when routing has heterogeneous candidates.

#### B-32. Context length 主动预检 — ⚠️ 部分 shipped (chars/4 heuristic, full fix pending tokenizer)
- **What shipped (in B-31 v2)**: `compatibility_check` 加 `ContextWindowExceeded { estimated_prompt_tokens, max_context_tokens }` 检测,用 `chars / 4` 启发式估算 prompt 大小。覆盖 obvious-overflow 场景:200k char request 打给 32k context provider 会被 routing 跳过,不浪费 wire round-trip。
- **What NOT shipped**: 真 tokenizer-based 精准检测。当前 chars/4 heuristic 在边界场景 (estimate ≈ 80-100% max) 有 ±20% 误差,所以只能可靠抓"明显超"的请求。borderline case 仍走 wire 等 provider 报错。
- **Trigger for full fix**: 真 tokenizer 集成 (D-5 unfreezes,挂 tiktoken / model-specific tokenizer)。或 downstream consumer 真撞到 borderline case 被频繁 false-negative 拖慢调试。
- **当前状态**: 80% 实用价值已在 (chars/4 救了 wire round-trip 浪费),20% 精度 case 暂留 wire-level fallback。**够用,trigger 没到不动**。

#### Middleware 顺序陷阱 (卷进 B-20 W1.2,不单独 entry)
- **Where**: `middleware.rs:96-98` `PipelineBuilder::layer` 文档说 "first call adds outermost",**只是文档约定,没 build-time 检查**
- **Gap**: 开发者把 Telemetry 放 Retry 内/外得到完全不同的可观测结果,编译期看不出。已知反模式:
  - Telemetry 在 Retry 内 → 记 N 次离散尝试,不知道这是同一业务请求
  - Telemetry 在 Retry 外 → 记 1 次总耗时,不知道内部 retry 几次
  - CacheLookup 在 Retry 内 → 命中缓存还触发 retry 路径,毫无意义
  - CircuitBreaker 在 Retry 外 → 熔断后还 retry,违反熔断意图
  - Validation 在 Retry 外 → ValidationFailed 触发的 retry 走不到外层
- **Fix**: `PipelineBuilder::build()` 加 `validate_order` 静态检查 — 已知反模式硬编码 lookup 表,违反就 panic with helpful message:
  ```rust
  fn validate_order(&self) -> Result<(), BuildError> {
      const ORDER_RULES: &[(name_outer, name_inner, reason)] = &[
          ("telemetry", "retry", "telemetry inside retry records per-attempt; flip them"),
          ("cache_lookup", "retry", "cache hit shouldn't enter retry path"),
          ("retry", "circuit_breaker", "circuit-broken provider shouldn't trigger retry"),
          ("retry", "validation", "ValidationFailed needs retry to wrap it"),
      ];
      // check pairs...
  }
  ```
- **不强类型 typestate**: 保留任意 layer 组合的扩展性,只在已知反模式上拦截。
- **进 B-20 W1.2** Pipeline.builder() build-time validation 子任务里一起做,**不开新 entry**。

### B-7. `tars-storage` — `ContentStore` + `KVStore` (EventStore done)
- `EventStore` + `SqliteEventStore` shipped — see CHANGELOG. Two traits still pending:
  - **`ContentStore`** — large-blob refs (image bytes, long-context payloads, raw LLM responses for parser-rewind replay). Slots in once `AgentEvent` payloads need to grow beyond the 4 KiB inline budget Doc 04 §3.2 sets, AND once we add the second `LlmResponseCaptured` event variant (separate from `LlmCallCaptured`) that carries the raw bytes.
  - **`KVStore`** — generic small-value persistence. Slots in when BudgetMiddleware (B-2 cap) needs cross-restart token-bucket state, OR when `tars-cache`'s SQLite L2 wants to be deduped onto a generalised KVStore. Today's `SqliteCacheRegistry` is fine standalone; refactoring just to share scaffolding would be O-style overengineering.
- **Postgres impls** for both EventStore + the future ContentStore/KVStore: M6 work (Doc 14).
- **Trigger**: ContentStore = first agent emits a payload that won't fit inline. KVStore = BudgetMiddleware or Tools idempotency table needs persistence.

### B-8. Full `tars-melt` (metrics, OTel exporter, cardinality validator, `SecretField<T>`)
- Mini version shipped — see CHANGELOG. Pending for M5 (Doc 14 §11): all metrics from Doc 08 §5, OTel SDK + OTLP exporter, cardinality validator, `SecretField<T>` generic wrapper (today `SecretString` covers the only consumer), trace head + tail sampling, `AdaptiveSampler`.
- **Trigger**: M5 starts (Doc 14 calls for it concurrent with CLI/TUI work).

### B-9. `tars-tools` — additional builtins + MCP + tool-call mini-pipeline
- Crate skeleton + `Tool` trait + `ToolRegistry` + `fs.read_file` + `fs.list_dir` + WorkerAgent integration shipped — see CHANGELOG. **Still missing**:
  - **Additional read-only builtins**: `git.fetch_pr_diff`, `web.fetch`. Each is mechanical — same pattern as the shipped `fs.*` tools. Trigger per item: first Worker run where the existing `fs.*` set isn't enough (typically a goal involving "look at git history" or "check this URL").
  - **`fs.write_file`** — gated on Backtrack + Saga (B-4). Writing without a rollback story is exactly the failure mode "tool ran, side effect committed, downstream step failed, no way to undo" we want to avoid normalising. Specifically: `fs.write_file` ships **after** `AgentEvent::CompensationExecuted` exists.
  - **`shell.exec`** — biggest blast radius. Ships **last**, with an explicit allowlist of binaries + jail + per-command audit log. Don't add until Saga + IAM both exist (B-4 + `tars-security` M6).
  - **Tool-call mini-pipeline** (Doc 05 §3.3) — onion of IAM check / idempotency dedupe / budget / audit / timeout around `ToolRegistry::dispatch`. Today's dispatch is bare. Each layer has its own consumer:
    - IAM check → blocked on `tars-security` (Doc 14 M6).
    - Idempotency dedupe (per-tool, distinct from `StepIdempotencyKey`) → blocked on KVStore (B-7).
    - Budget → blocked on BudgetMiddleware (B-2).
    - Timeout → could ship now; defer until first long-running tool.
    - Audit → could ship now; pairs naturally with `tars-melt` metrics (B-8).
  - **MCP integration** (Doc 05 §5) — load external tool servers over the standard MCP protocol. Big surface; defer until either (a) a user has a specific MCP server they want to plug in, OR (b) we hit the wall of "writing built-ins for everything is unsustainable".
- **Trigger / order per item above**.

## Doc 01 — LLM Provider gap items

Audit run 2026-05-03 against `docs/architecture/01-llm-provider.md`. Code currently implements ~85% of the doc surface (HTTP + CLI + capability + tool-call + structured-output + cache directive + error model + registry are all in). What's still missing:

> **Vocabulary in this section** — drawn from the `defer > delete > implement` lifecycle:
>
> - **Deferred** = "haven't built yet, but the trigger is plausible — likely to revisit." Default classification.
> - **Frozen** = "haven't built, and don't expect to. Documented for completeness; reads more like an option closed than a TODO." Has its own meta-entry at D-11. Strikethrough on commit, not on freeze.

### D-1. `ExplicitCacheProvider` sub-trait (Doc 01 §10)
- `create_cache(content, ttl) -> ProviderCacheHandle`, `delete_cache(&handle)`, `extend_ttl(&handle, additional)`. Anthropic + Gemini implement; OpenAI never (auto-cache only).
- **Why deferred**: Caller-side has no Janitor / Cache Registry yet to issue creates and track handles. Adding the trait without consumers means dead code per the O-prefix decision rule.
- **Trigger**: When `tars-cache` lands and needs to reach into provider-side caches.
- **Blocker for**: Real cost control on Anthropic-heavy workloads (Doc 01 §10.1 "must actively delete").

### D-2. `Auth::SecretManager` + `Auth::GoogleAdc` + `per_tenant_home` flag
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/auth.rs`. Doc 01 §7 lists 6 Auth variants; we have 3 (None / Delegate / Secret{SecretRef}).
- **Missing**:
  - `Auth::SecretManager { backend: Vault|Aws|Gcp|Azure, key }` — pluggable secret backends
  - `Auth::GoogleAdc { scope: Vec<String> }` — Application Default Credentials for Vertex / Gemini
  - `per_tenant_home` flag on `Auth::Delegate` — multi-tenant CLI HOME isolation (Doc 01 §6.2 + §7)
- **Why deferred**: All three live in the future `tars-security` crate (Doc 14 M6). The `BasicAuthResolver` in `tars-provider` is documented as "test/personal-mode"; production resolvers swap in.
- **Trigger**: M6 (Multi-tenant + Postgres + 安全) per Doc 14.

### D-3. mistral.rs embedded backend (Doc 01 §6.3) — ❄️ Frozen (see D-11)
- In-process LLM inference via `mistral.rs` crate. Apple Silicon Metal backend especially useful for the Mac Pro node (covers same posture as MLX but Rust-native, no `mlx_lm.server` subprocess).
- **Why deferred**: Adds a heavy native dep + GPU-toolchain CI pain. The `mlx`/`llamacpp` HTTP-server backends already cover the same hardware via subprocess. No call-path benefit until someone needs in-process inference (e.g. embedded scenarios with no network stack).
- **Trigger**: First user with "I want zero-process, Rust-only inference" — likely an embedded / WASM-adjacent use case.

### D-4. ONNX `ClassifierProvider` trait (Doc 01 §6.3) — ❄️ Frozen (see D-11)
- Separate trait — **not** `LlmProvider`. Used by PromptGuard middleware's slow lane (DeBERTa injection classifier).
- **Why deferred**: PromptGuard middleware itself doesn't exist (B-2 list). Trait without consumers = dead code.
- **Trigger**: When PromptGuard slow-lane is implemented (Doc 14 M4).

### D-5. Real tokenizer for `count_tokens` (Doc 01 §3 + §15.1) — ❄️ Frozen (see D-11)
- `LlmProvider::count_tokens(req, fast=false)` is supposed to load the real tokenizer (`tiktoken-rs` for OpenAI, `tokenizers` for HF-tokenized models). Current default impl ignores `fast` and always returns `chars/4`.
- **Why deferred**: Budget middleware (the only consumer that needs real counts) doesn't exist. Doc 01 §15.1 is explicit: "don't do precise token counting on the request path; estimate with chars/4, get truth from `response.usage`."
- **Trigger**: When BudgetMiddleware needs pre-flight precision to reject requests over the per-tenant cap *before* incurring provider cost.

### D-6. `capabilities_override` config field (Doc 01 §13) — ❄️ Frozen (see D-11)
- Per-provider TOML can override the built-in capability profile (e.g. local llama.cpp deployment with `supports_thinking = false, prompt_cache = "none"`). Currently capabilities are hardcoded per backend builder.
- **Why deferred**: We can already achieve this in code via `OpenAiProviderBuilder::capabilities(...)`; just not from config. Adding the TOML deserialization is small (~30 lines) but low-value until users have heterogeneous local deployments.
- **Trigger**: First user TOML-only deployment that needs to flag a capability off (e.g. "this vLLM doesn't actually do strict JSON, please don't route strict-output requests here").

### D-7. `ContextTooLong { limit, requested }` populated from error message (Doc 01 §11.1)
- All HTTP adapters currently classify context overflow as `ProviderError::ContextTooLong { limit: 0, requested: 0 }` — typed correctly but with placeholder numbers. Doc 01 §11.1 says these fields enable "上层有明确处理路径（截断 / 摘要）". Without the numbers, callers can't make the truncation decision intelligently.
- **Where**: `crates/tars-provider/src/backends/{openai,anthropic,gemini}.rs` — `classify_error` paths.
- **Why deferred**: Each provider's error message format is different and changes without notice. Real fix is "regex over the message body" — hacky but unavoidable.
- **Trigger**: First time the agent loop hits a long-context request and the truncation policy needs the actual numbers (not just the error class). Until then `0/0` is honest about "we know it overflowed, we don't know by how much".

### D-8. Routing layer (Doc 01 §12) — ⏳ partial: M2 cut shipped, advanced policies pending
- **Shipped (a4ebba9)**: `RoutingPolicy` trait + `StaticPolicy` + `TierPolicy` + `RoutingService` (bottom-of-pipeline LlmService). FallbackChain inlined into `RoutingService.call`'s try-each loop — simpler than a wrapper type. CLI `--tier` flag + config `[routing.tiers]` section. `CircuitBreaker` (caf0043) pairs naturally: when a candidate's breaker opens, the typed `ProviderError::CircuitOpen` (Retriable) makes routing fall through automatically.
- **Still pending — all blocked on metrics infra (B-8 / M5)**:
  - `CostPolicy` (per-provider cost tracking)
  - `LatencyPolicy` (per-provider P50 tracking)
  - `EnsemblePolicy` (parallel fan-out + merge — also needs a merge primitive)
- **Tied to**: O-4 (Capabilities slimming) — routing's actual reads decide which fields stay. After M3 lands, audit Capabilities against routing usage.

### D-12. CLI-provider conformance (Doc 01 §14 follow-on) — ⚡ trigger fired
- The HTTP-backend conformance suite (D-9, shipped) doesn't cover `claude_cli` / `gemini_cli` / `codex_cli` — their wire path is fundamentally different (no SSE, no HTTP; subprocess JSON). They'd need a `Scenarios` impl that mounts a fake subprocess runner instead of wiremock.
- **Trigger fired** with codex_cli (`a4e2254`): the 3rd subprocess-style backend has landed. We're paying the per-backend test maintenance cost across 3 separate test files (`*_smoke.rs` for live + per-backend unit tests for mock paths).
- **Each CLI backend's existing tests** (with `FakeRunner` for unit + `*_smoke.rs` for live) DO cover its specific surface. The `Scenarios` harness would dedupe the cross-backend invariants (env-strip pattern, JSON-or-text decoding, cancel-via-Drop, timeout handling, model-not-supported error → ProviderError). Worth ~1 day of refactor; payoff is "add the 4th CLI backend in 100 lines instead of 500".
- **Updated trigger**: when adding a 4th CLI backend (e.g. Cursor CLI, Cline CLI, ChatGPT app's hidden CLI, etc.) — at that point the dedupe pays for itself in one go.

### D-13. Live-API nightly conformance tier (Doc 01 §14)
- Doc 01 §14 calls for a nightly CI tier hitting REAL APIs (~$0.01/run) so the `Scenarios` wiremock fixtures don't drift from the actual provider behaviour. This is the safety net that catches "OpenAI changed the streaming format last week and our fixtures are now lying".
- **Why deferred**: needs a budget mechanism + secret management for the API keys + a separate CI workflow. No urgency until provider-side breakage actually happens.
- **Trigger**: First confirmed wire-format change at any of OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini that our local conformance suite missed because the fixture was stale.

### D-10. Doc 01 §17 open questions
Verbatim from the doc; tracked here so they don't get lost:
- mistral.rs Metal-backend verification on Apple Silicon (blocked by D-3)
- Claude Code CLI `interrupt` JSONL command spec confirmation across versions (blocked by B-1)
- Gemini CLI stream-protocol maturity assessment (blocked by B-1)
- OAuth token auto-refresh for Anthropic + Google (blocked by D-2)
- ONNX classifier multi-thread inference scheduling (blocked by D-4)

### D-11. ❄️ Frozen Doc 01 items — explicit "don't pursue" decisions
Recorded 2026-05-03 after a `defer > delete > implement` review. These are **not** "haven't gotten to yet" — they're "looked at, decided no, here's why". The trigger conditions still apply and could thaw an item, but absent the trigger we don't read these as work backlog.

| ID | Frozen because | Thaw trigger |
|----|----------------|--------------|
| D-3 mistral.rs embedded | MLX (subprocess) + llama.cpp cover the same hardware via the existing OpenAI-compat adapter. In-process FFI adds a heavy native dep + GPU-toolchain CI pain for zero current user benefit. | A user with a no-network embedded / WASM-adjacent posture, OR a measured perf gap where subprocess overhead actually matters. |
| D-4 ONNX `ClassifierProvider` | PromptGuard middleware (the only consumer) is M4 work. Trait without consumers = dead code we'd have to maintain. | When PromptGuard slow-lane gets implemented (M4 per Doc 14). |
| D-5 Real tokenizer | Doc 01 §15.1 explicitly says "don't precise-count on the request path". `chars/4` is correct for our only consumer (a future BudgetMiddleware) until pre-flight rejection precision actually matters. tiktoken-rs is ~30 MB binary bloat per provider family. | When BudgetMiddleware needs to reject pre-flight (i.e. a tenant is hitting their cap often enough that the wasted provider call has measurable cost). |
| D-6 `capabilities_override` config field | The escape hatch already exists in code (`OpenAiProviderBuilder::capabilities(...)`). Adding TOML deserialization is ~30 lines of pure plumbing for a feature we can't recall a single concrete user of. | First TOML-only deployment that needs to flag a capability off (e.g. "this self-hosted vLLM doesn't actually do strict JSON, please don't route strict-output requests here"). |

**What is *not* frozen** — explicitly listed so future-me doesn't conflate "deferred" with "frozen":
- **Tool calling** stays a first-class feature. Already wired across 5 backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, vLLM, MLX/llamacpp). Capability flags (`supports_tool_use`, `supports_parallel_tool_calls`) handle the per-model variation cleanly; we don't try to "fix" Llama-3 quantized model tool-call format chaos in the universal layer — that's exactly D-4's domain (PromptGuard ≠ tool-call adapter, but the same "don't pollute the universal type with provider-quirk handling" principle).
- **D-1 ExplicitCacheProvider**, **D-2 Auth::SecretManager / GoogleAdc**, **D-7 ContextTooLong numbers**, **D-12 CLI-provider conformance**, **D-13 live-API nightly tier** — all still expected to land; the trigger conditions are concrete and likely to fire within v1.0 timeline (Doc 14 M3-M6).
- **D-8 Routing** + **D-9 conformance suite** are partially or fully shipped — see CHANGELOG. Remaining sub-items (Cost / Latency / Ensemble policies; CLI + nightly conformance tiers) live in their own entries above.

## Process notes

- **Two files, two roles**:
  - `TODO.md` (this file) is forward-only: deferred / frozen / audit-deferred items + the trigger conditions for each. Reading top-to-bottom answers "what's NOT done and why".
  - `CHANGELOG.md` is the shipped-items audit trail organized by milestone. Reading top-to-bottom answers "what IS done, in roughly what order".
- **Don't delete deferred items silently** — they're institutional memory ("we considered this and decided X"). Items move OUT of TODO.md only when:
  - shipped → relocated to CHANGELOG.md (with the trigger marked satisfied), OR
  - explicitly decided "never doing this" → strikethrough + a one-line "why" stays here. Don't delete; the strikethrough is the audit signal.
- **Trigger conditions are real** — when one fires, open the corresponding work, don't just shuffle the line.
- When in doubt: `defer > delete > implement`. Premature deletion is also overengineering.
- **Deferred ≠ Frozen**. Deferred = expected to ship. Frozen = explicit "no" with thaw conditions. See D-11 for the current frozen list.
