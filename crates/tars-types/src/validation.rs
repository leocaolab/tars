//! Output-validation primitives shared across crates.
//!
//! `OutputValidator` itself lives in `tars-pipeline` (it depends on
//! Pipeline-internal types). The data types here are what flow
//! between caller code and the validator chain — they need to be
//! constructible / inspectable without taking a `tars-pipeline`
//! dependency. See [Doc 15 — Output Validation](../../../docs/architecture/15-output-validation.md).
//!
//! Threaded through:
//!
//! - **`ValidationOutcome`** — a validator's per-call verdict
//!   (Pass / Filter / Reject / Annotate). Returned by validator
//!   implementations; consumed by `ValidationMiddleware`.
//! - **`ValidationSummary`** — final aggregated record of what
//!   validators did during one call, attached to
//!   [`crate::ChatResponse::validation_summary`].
//! - **`OutcomeSummary`** — summary of a single validator's outcome
//!   for the summary record. Reject doesn't appear here because
//!   Reject short-circuits the call into an error path.
