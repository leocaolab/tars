# TODO

Living list. Each entry: **what** to do, **why** it's deferred (not "shouldn't", just "not now"), and a **trigger** for when to revisit.

## Overengineering — defer-and-revisit list

These were called out in the self-review on 2026-05-03. Decision: **keep** for now (rip-them-out cost > carry cost in the short term), but each has a trigger condition. When the trigger fires we either commit to the abstraction or delete it.

### O-1. `HttpTransport` trait + `OutboundRequest` / `HttpResponse` / `StreamResponse` wrappers
- **Where**: `crates/tars-provider/src/transport.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Borrowed from codex-rs but currently has zero call sites. All providers go straight through `HttpProviderBase.client`. wiremock + the existing integration tests cover everything we need today.
- **Trigger to commit**: A second test that genuinely benefits from a non-HTTP fake transport (e.g. a unit test that wants to assert "the adapter built this exact OutboundRequest" without spinning up wiremock).
- **Trigger to delete**: We hit `tars-pipeline` MVP without anyone needing it.

### O-2. `HttpProviderExtras` — `http_headers` / `env_http_headers` / `query_params`
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/http_extras.rs`, embedded via `#[serde(flatten)]` in 5 ProviderConfig variants
- **Why deferred**: Borrowed from codex-rs's `ModelProviderInfo`. No user has asked for any of these fields. None of our tests use them.
- **Trigger to commit**: First user request — most likely "I need `OpenAI-Organization` header set from env" or "Azure deployment ID in query string."
- **Trigger to delete**: 6 months without a user request → the `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` interaction noise outweighs the latent capability.

### O-3. `Pricing` as a configurable struct (5 × f64 fields)
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/usage.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Designed as if users will customize per-deployment. In practice we have ~5 providers × ~3 models = 15 const data points.
- **Better shape**: `const PRICING: &[(provider_id, model_pattern, Pricing)]` table with helper lookup. Users override only when they have private deployments with negotiated rates.
- **Trigger**: When we add a real cost-display feature (admin dashboard / billing export). The cost table will need to live somewhere — that's the moment to switch from "field on Capabilities" to a proper pricing module.

### O-4. `Capabilities` 12-field struct
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/capabilities.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Currently 0 readers — no routing layer, no pipeline middleware. Completely speculative.
- **Trigger to commit**: First Routing policy that actually filters by capability (e.g. `RequiresVision` model selection).
- **Trigger to slim**: At the moment we build Routing, audit what fields it really reads and drop the rest. Likely we end up with 5 fields (streaming / tool_use / structured_output / max_context / pricing).

### O-5. `Auth::Secret { secret: SecretRef }` nested enum variant
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/auth.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Cosmetic. `Auth::Env { var }` would read better than `Auth::Secret { secret: SecretRef::Env { var } }`.
- **Trigger to flatten**: If we add a second auth-class concept (e.g. mTLS client cert) that's NOT a "secret reference" — at that point the enum reshuffle is forced anyway.

### O-6. `ToolCallBuffer::take_started` flag
- **Where**: `crates/tars-provider/src/tool_buffer.rs`, used by `crates/tars-provider/src/backends/openai.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Functionally correct, just placed wrong. Stream-level state shoved into a struct named for tool calls.
- **Cleaner**: Either let `Started` events repeat (consumer dedupes — `ChatResponseBuilder` already handles it) and drop the flag, OR introduce a proper `StreamState { tool_buf, started_emitted, … }`.
- **Trigger**: Next time we add a third per-stream flag → tipping point for the rename.

### O-7. `SecretString` is theatre, not protection
- **Where**: `crates/tars-types/src/secret.rs`
- **Why deferred**: The Display/Debug redaction does prevent accidental log leaks (real value). Memory-level protection (zeroize on drop, locked pages) is genuinely missing — but writing real secret-protection without a clear threat model is its own overengineering trap.
- **Trigger to harden**: First customer with a security review that asks "are secrets zeroized in memory?" Add `zeroize` crate at that point.
- **Rename consideration**: `RedactedDisplay<T>` would be more honest about scope. Defer to first non-secret use case (PII strings, etc.).

### O-8. `ProviderRegistry::{ids, len, is_empty}` "complete API"
- **Where**: `crates/tars-provider/src/registry.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Trivial. Either get used by routing or are never read.
- **Trigger to delete**: After Pipeline lands, grep `.ids()` `.len()` `.is_empty()` against the Registry. Anything with 0 callers — gone.

### O-9. `tars-config::builtin` 5-provider default table
- **Where**: `crates/tars-config/src/builtin.rs`
- **Why deferred**: Useful for "zero-config first-run" UX, but we have no first-run UX (no `tars init` command yet).
- **Trigger to keep**: When we ship a CLI binary with a `tars init` flow that scaffolds a minimal config — the defaults make user TOML one-liner short.
- **Trigger to delete**: If we never ship that CLI flow, the defaults are unused fixtures.

### O-10. Speculative documentation
- **Doc 06 §8** (Tenant provision/suspend/delete 7-step cascade) — designed for a system with no second tenant
- **Doc 09** (Storage Schema) — full Postgres schemas for tables that don't exist
- **Doc 13** (entire Operational Runbook) — 12 incident playbooks for incidents that haven't happened
- **Doc 12 §5** (gRPC), **§8** (WASM) — speculative API surfaces
- **Why deferred**: Already written. Reading them costs nothing. Implementing them prematurely WOULD cost something.
- **Trigger to revise**: When the actual subsystem ships, audit the doc for what we got wrong vs. right. Don't try to keep them current ahead of code.

## Audit follow-up — non-critical findings to revisit

The 2026-05-03 A.R.C. review (`3ab2b7fa`) flagged 208 issues; commit `9683ce8` fixed the 1 critical and 9 of the 51 errors. The rest are deferred:

### A-1. Test quality (148 warnings, 8 info)
Most warnings are `happy-path-only-enumeration` or `assertion-strength-mismatch` — tests cover the main path but not edge cases.
- **Trigger**: Dedicated test-hardening pass, or whenever we touch the relevant module for another reason.

### A-2. `Capabilities` invariant gaps (audit:capabilities-{2,3})
- Empty `modalities_in/out` HashSets allowed; `StructuredOutputMode::ToolUseEmulation` doesn't enforce `supports_tool_use = true`.
- **Trigger**: Tied to O-4 — when Capabilities gets readers, validate at construction time.

### A-3. `usage.rs` `saturating_sub` masking invalid usage data
- If `cached + creation > input`, `billable_input` silently becomes 0 and we under-bill.
- **Trigger**: When we build telemetry for cost reconciliation, log a warning when the saturation path triggers.

### A-4. `events.rs` `ToolCallArgsDelta` lacks `id` field
- Correlation relies on `index` alone. If a provider ever reuses an index across calls in the same stream, args get cross-contaminated.
- **Trigger**: First time a provider's streaming protocol surfaces this. Anthropic and OpenAI both use stable index per stream today; not a real bug yet.

### A-5. `cache.rs` `SystemTime` serialization
- Default serde for `SystemTime` is non-portable across platforms.
- **Trigger**: When ProviderCacheHandle gets persisted (Doc 03 implementation) — switch to `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` or epoch millis.

## Real backlog (not overengineering)

### B-1. CLI providers: long-lived stream-json mode (Doc 01 §6.2.1)
- Current `claude_cli` / `gemini_cli` spawn a fresh subprocess per call (cold start 200-500ms).
- **Goal**: Long-lived process pool with `--output-format stream-json` for low-latency interactive use.
- **Cost**: ~1 week of careful work (cancel guards, session pool lifecycle, JSONL bidi protocol).

### B-2. `tars-pipeline` skeleton (Doc 02)
- Tower-style middleware framework with the Doc 02 onion layers.
- **Order**: Telemetry → Auth → IAM → Budget → Cache → Guard → Routing → CircuitBreaker → Retry.
- **MVP scope**: Just the trait + Routing + RetryMiddleware. Other layers fill in later as their dependencies ship.

### B-3. Hot reload for `ConfigManager` (Doc 06 §6)
- Currently load-once. Real-world: change `~/.config/tars/config.toml` and have it pick up without restart.
- **Trigger**: First user demo where "I want to switch providers without restarting" matters.

### B-4. SQLite event store + Trajectory tree (Doc 04 §3, Doc 09 §4)
- The actual M3 Agent Runtime work.
- **Blockers**: Pipeline (B-2) needs to exist first.

### B-5. `tars-cli` binary
- Wires up CLI Mode adapter (Doc 07 §5).
- **Trigger**: After Pipeline + at least one Skill is testable end-to-end.

### B-6. PyO3 + napi-rs bindings (Doc 12 §6, §7)
- **Trigger**: First Python or Node user.

## Process notes

- **Do not delete from this list silently** — strikethrough with date instead, so we keep the institutional memory of "we considered this and decided X".
- **Trigger conditions are real** — when one fires, open the corresponding work, don't just shuffle the line.
- When in doubt: `defer > delete > implement`. Premature deletion is also overengineering.
